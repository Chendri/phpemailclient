# phpemailclient
Simple PHP email client for sending and receiving email messages.

Please note.
You'll need to write your own config/config.php, I left it out of the repository for security reasons.
Also, in order for the client to work properly through gmail, an MSMTP set up is required. Refer to this article for more information https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-gmail-or-yahoo-with-php-mail-function
